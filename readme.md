this is a quiz application made from turbo c++ using graphic.h library. This quiz application has four main sections, made for students, teachers,
hod, and administrator. Teachers have to prepare the test which is then saved in the file. the questions saved in the file are used to 
generate a quiz interface for the students.students can give the test prepared by the teacher. HOD and Administrator can also prepare the test 
and delete the questions as per their requirements.

The include file consists of object.h file which contains the declarations and definitions  of functions used frequently in the programs like drawing of boxes,
message box etc. The main menu contains the definitons of  menu functions that can be used commonly by the interfaces of students , teachers,
etc to generate the coresponding menus. Then is the file named interface which contains the definitions of objects for teachers,students ,
administrator and HOD and provides the interfaces for their functionality. At the top level, is the file named windows which consists of 
the functions and objects which controls the flow of programs and organizes the flow of control.

the program is functioning perfectly fine .
